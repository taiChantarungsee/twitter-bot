# twitter-bot

A Clojure app that will automatically tweet a selection of lines. Used following tutorial: https://howistart.org/posts/clojure/1, which I recommend, but will modify significantly as I play around with clojure. The twitter account is: https://twitter.com/Quasimodomus. 'profiles.clj' needs to be filled in with relevant twitter account info.
